<h3>Security that's foolproof</h3>
<h4>Prying eyes are not a problem when you have iris scanning on the Galaxy S8 and S8+. Your irises have patterns that are unique to you, and they're nearly impossible to replicate. That means with iris scanning, your phone and its contents open to your eyes only. And when you need to unlock really fast, face recognition is a handy option.
*The iris is the colored, ring-shaped part of your eye.</h4>

<h3> Faster, even in rain </h3>
</h4>You never really stop using your phone. That's why Galaxy S8 and S8+ are driven by the world's first 10nm processor. It's fast and powerful and increases battery efficiency. Plus, there's the ability to expand storage, and to work through rain and dust with IP68-rated performance.</h4>
<h1> Say Hello To Bixby! </h1>
