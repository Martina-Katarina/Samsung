<h4 style="font-family:Times New Roman;"><font color=#000000>Prying eyes are not a problem when you have iris scanning on the Galaxy S8 and S8+. Your irises have patterns that are unique to you, and they're nearly impossible to replicate. That means with iris scanning, your phone and its contents open to your eyes only. And when you need to unlock really fast, face recognition is a handy option.</font>
